  "faq.metaDescription": "Quick hits on TOP-X: Login, privacy, games, and more ego-bruising answers.",
  "faq.items.login.question": "Why log in to TOP-X?",
  "faq.items.login.answer": "Sign in to unleash the full glory: save your past plays, results & picks, climb leaderboards, spy on friends' picks, and trash-talk rivals. Without it? Fun previews only - no community showdowns or ego boosts. Log in & rise to the challenge! 🔑",
  "faq.items.security.question": "Is logging in with X secure?",
  "faq.items.security.answer": "Absolutely! We use X's ironclad OAuth - minimal access, max privacy. No peeking at DMs, no posting on your behalf. Your data's locked down tighter than a vault in Fort Knox. 🔒💪",
  "faq.items.permissions.question": "What X permissions does TOP-X need?",
  "faq.items.permissions.answer": "Just the basics: your public profile (username + pic) for personalization - to prevent fakes and duplicate votes. We skip the rest - no private posts, no follows lists. Privacy first, ego-bruises second! 📋",
  "faq.items.permissionPrompt.question": "Why does X ask for several permissions?",
  "faq.items.permissionPrompt.answer": "X's default prompt is overkill - it's the bare minimum they allow for any app. Stuff like \"protected posts\" (locked accounts) or \"who you follow/block\"? We ignore it all. We only snag your username + pic - nothing else touches your feed. Promise: No meddling, no posting, just pure U vs X vibes. Chill & connect! 😎",
  "faq.items.dataProtection.question": "How is my data protected?",
  "faq.items.dataProtection.answer": "Firebase secures your info with top-tier encryption - minimal collection (just what you share), full privacy compliance. You control it all; we don't sell or snoop. Ego-bruises? Yes. Data drama? Never. 🔒🛡️",
  "faq.items.free.question": "Is TOP-X free?",
  "faq.items.free.answer": "Totally free! All challenges are free. Jump in, play, compete, rank, flex, and top them all without dropping a dime. 🆓🏆",
  "faq.items.unique.question": "What makes TOP-X unique?",
  "faq.items.unique.answer": "We're Grok-powered (99% xAI magic 🤖) + human vibe-coded 💖 for that unbeatable edge. We ride trends like pros - weekly drops tailored to X's hottest buzz. Fast, techy, and ego-bruising: Pyramids for GOAT debates, trivia smackdowns, and viral rivalries. No stale games - fresh battles every week! ⚡📈",
  "faq.items.powered.question": "What's the deal with \"Powered by Grok 99%\"?",
  "faq.items.powered.answer": "Grok (xAI's powerhouse) built 99% of TOP-X: code, games, content, even marketing sparks. It's like having an AI wizard on speed-dial for trend-riding glory. Humans add the final 1% vibe-code for that human spark. Grok crunches, we perfect the punch! 🤖🔥",
  "faq.items.vibeCoding.question": "What's vibe-coding?",
  "faq.items.vibeCoding.answer": "Vibe-coding is our secret sauce: Humans tweaking Grok's 99% AI output for that irresistible feel - cheeky, competitive, trend-connected. It's not just code; it's ego-bruising energy, trash-talk tweaks, and U vs X flair. Grok crunches the tech; we code the vibes. 💖⚔️",
  "faq.items.games.question": "What games & challenges are available?",
  "faq.items.games.answer": "Pyramids of glory (rank GOATs like football legends or prez rivalries), trivia takedowns (test your smarts vs the feed), quizzes that bruise egos, and many more mini-games, ego-busters and showdowns. More dropping weekly. Rise, rival, conquer! 🎮📊",
  "faq.items.howToPlay.question": "How do I play & what's recommended?",
  "faq.items.howToPlay.answer": "Easy: Pick a challenge (pyramids, trivia, quizzes or other), build/rank/quiz/play away, then share for trash-talk gold. Start with a pyramid - stack your GOATs, log in for leaderboards, follow players for friends/rival peeks. Pro tip: Share everywhere (X, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram) to rally your crew. Top them all! 🎯",
  "faq.items.sharing.question": "Can I share my pyramids, results, or game stuff?",
  "faq.items.sharing.answer": "Heck yeah - we encourage it! Grab the image, paste our pre-copied text, and flex on X or anywhere. It rallies more players, unlocks community results, and lets you spy who's topping yours. Win-win ego glory! 📸🏆",
  "faq.items.shareWithFriends.question": "How do I share with friends?",
  "faq.items.shareWithFriends.answer": "Easy ego-flex: Hit the share button after a challenge - it auto-downloads your image (pyramid, trivia score, etc.) and copies custom text. Paste into X, WhatsApp, or anywhere - tag your crew, trash-talk, and rally them to top yours. Pre-loaded with our URL for viral vibes. Share & top 'em all! 📸👥",
  "faq.items.noX.question": "If I don't have X, what can I do?",
  "faq.items.noX.answer": "Open an X account <a href=\"https://x.com/signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"has-text-primary\">here</a> - Seriously, how do you live without it? 😜 It's just two seconds! Or jump in without logging in - half the features (like results, leaderboards, following) won't unlock, but you can still play challenges and share images on other platforms (WhatsApp, Facebook, etc.). Ego-bruise lite mode! 📱",
  "faq.items.follow.question": "Why follow @topxapp?",
  "faq.items.follow.answer": "For the inside scoop: Weekly drops, RTs of your wins, glory shots (spotlights & scores), and trend alerts.

  "faq.items.future.question": "What's next for TOP-X?",
  "faq.items.future.answer": "Grok 4's dropping epic upgrades soon. Weekly challenges synced to X storms: More pyramids, polls, mini games and challenges at the speed of a keystroke. Shaped by your feedback - join the VIP crew for input! We've got tons more surprises in store, but Grok recommends keeping mum for now. Stay tuned & top the future! 🚀📈",
  "faq.items.whyReading.question": "Why am I still reading this FAQ instead of logging in & playing?",
  "faq.items.whyReading.answer": "Probably overthinking the ego-bruise... or scared you won't top 'em all? 😏 Nah, you're ready - take the leap, sign in securely, and claim the throne.
