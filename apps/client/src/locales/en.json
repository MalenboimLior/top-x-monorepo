  "faq.items.security.answer": "Absolutely! We use X's ironclad OAuth - minimal access, max privacy. No peeking at DMs, no posting on your behalf. Your data's locked down tighter than a vault in Fort Knox. 🔒💪",

  "faq.items.permissionPrompt.question": "Why does X ask for several permissions?",
  "faq.items.permissionPrompt.answer": "X's default prompt is overkill - it's the bare minimum they allow for any app. Stuff like \"protected posts\" (locked accounts) or \"who you follow/block\"?

  "faq.items.dataProtection.question": "How is my data protected?",
  "faq.items.dataProtection.answer": "Firebase secures your info with top-tier encryption - minimal collection (just what you share), full privacy compliance. You control it all; we don't sell or snoop. Ego-bruises? Yes. Data drama? Never. 🔒🛡️",

  "faq.items.shareWithFriends.question": "How do I share with friends?",
  "faq.items.shareWithFriends.answer": "Easy ego-flex: Hit the share button after a challenge - it auto-downloads your image (pyramid, trivia score, etc.) and copies custom text. Paste into X, WhatsApp, or anywhere - tag your crew, trash-talk, and rally them to top yours. Pre-loaded with our URL for viral vibes. Share & top 'em all! 📸👥",
  "faq.items.noX.question": "If I don't have X, what can I do?",
