TOP-X is a monorepo containing two Vue 3 applications — a player-facing client and an admin dashboard — built with TypeScript, Vite, Firebase (via vuefire), and a shared package for common logic and UI components.
The project delivers a social gaming platform with user-generated mini-games, leaderboards, and profile features.
